        <p>Hey there! I'm Suyan Shrestha, a Computer Engineering student at Khwopa College of Engineering.
        <br/> My skills span HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Python, and data visualization. From crafting seamless web applications to managing data with MongoDB and Cassandra, I bring both frontend and backend expertise to the table. Beyond the tech realm, my heart beats to the rhythm of music â€“ a constant inspiration during coding sessions. I'm passionate about the ever-evolving tech landscape and keen to contribute my skills to innovative projects. Let's connect for a chat on coding, music recommendations, or any exciting collaborations waiting to unfold! </p>
